                <h1> Mathura  Vrindavan Govardhan</h1>
                <p>It is true that Mathura is the birthplace of Lord Krishna, the incarnation of <br>Lord
                    Vishnu.Traditionally it is also recognized as the capital of Braj Bhoomi.<br>Mathura is located
                    in Uttar Pradesh and is located at a distance of 145 km <br> southeast of Delhi and the
                    northwestern part of Agra at a distance of 58 km<br>into two parts, one part occupying places like
                    Mahavan, Baldeo, Mat and <br >Bajna and the western part of Yamuna that covers the Mathura
                    region <br>encompassing Vrindavan, Govardhan, Kusum Sarovar, Barsana and Nandgaon..
                           <br>In Vrindavan there are some special places with fascinating histories.Like 
                           <br>Nidhivan is a very beautiful kunja of small trees. According to Vishwanath
                           <br>Chakravarty Thakur when Lord Krishna left Rasalila to find Srimati 
                           <br>Radharani, this is the place where it had happened.she's seen as equal
                           <br>to Krishna, the other half of his soul split in two a long time before,
                           <br>and finally coming back to each other. Their love was inevitable,even
                           <br>though he left her behind and went on to conquer the world.
                           <br>You'll always remember your first.
                           <br>Govardhan Puja is celebrated on the day after Diwali. It is the day upon
                           <br>which Lord Krishna defeated Indra, the deity of thunder and rain.As per 
                           <br> the story, Krishna saw huge preparations for the annual offering to Indra
                           <br>to Indra and questions his father Nanda about it.
