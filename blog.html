            <h2>Radha krishna blog</h2>
            <p>Radha is the incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi, who is the wife of Vishnu.
            She is sometimes called “Radharani.From childhood, she was very devoted to
            Krishna,who was also her foster brother. Though Radha and Krishna never
             married, her intense love for Krishna represents both the married, her 
            intense love for Krishna represents both the love a wife has for her
            husband and the love a devotee has for the divine. Since Radha and
            Krishna were children when they fell in love, their love for each other was 
            very pure and spiritual, the ideal love. When Krishna left his childhood  
            </p>
            <br>


            <p>The birth of Krishna was an unusual event. His mother, the princess Devaki, 
                had been imprisoned by the demon king Kamsa because a prophecy said that 
                her eighth child would kill the demon. Devaki’s first six children were 
                killed immediately. Her seventh escaped when Devaki pretended to have a 
                miscarriage,and her eighth child, Krishna, was exchanged for a cowherd’s
                daughter.
                </p>
                <br>
                 
                 
                <p>Though Krishna is the ultimate divine being, Radha is the Supreme Goddess
                This is because while Krishna has power over all things, Radha,through 
                 his love for her, has control over him. This gives Radha a position of 
                immense power. Without each other, however, they are meaningless: Krishna
                would not be Krishna without his beloved Radha, and Radha would be empty
                and lost without Krishna. 
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <p>The worship of Krishna may have started as early as the 5th century BCE. Today he
                 is worshipped as the supreme Hindu god by many believers, and he is especially 
                 revered in Bengal and Udupi in southern India. One of the many festivals held in
                 his honour is the ratha-yatra chariot festival in Puri which commemorates Radha's 
                 successful attempt to persuade Krishna to return to Vrindavana.</p>
